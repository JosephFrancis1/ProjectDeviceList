Python script to take all devices associated with a project and formats them for client facing purposes.

Before executing the python script a csv file containing all devices for a given project must be downloaded from the metabase custom query section. This is done by searching for devices and filtering by desired project.

To run the script type the following into the command line in terminal and execute:

python DeviceCoords.py 'path to downloaded csvfile'

Copy the entire output and paste it into the DeviceIDs table, found within the API guide.
